# AMR Audio Conversion Guide

AMR (Adaptive Multi-Rate) files are commonly used for voice recordings on mobile devices, especially WhatsApp voice notes. However, they cannot be played directly in web browsers.

## Why AMR Files Don't Play in Browsers

- **Not HTML5 Standard**: Browsers only natively support MP3, WAV, M4A, and OGG formats
- **Mobile-Optimized**: AMR is designed for mobile voice calls and messaging apps
- **Codec Limitations**: Web browsers don't include AMR decoders for security and licensing reasons

## File Size Comparison

| Original AMR | Converted MP3 | Quality |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| 1MB (5 min)  | 0.7MB (64kbps) | Good for voice |
| 1MB (5 min)  | 1.2MB (96kbps) | Better for voice |
| 1MB (5 min)  | 2.4MB (192kbps) | Excellent for music |

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Keep Original Files**: Always backup your original AMR files
2. **Batch Convert**: Convert multiple files at once to save time
3. **Test Quality**: Listen to converted files before uploading
4. **Use MP3**: Most compatible format for web playback
5. **Consider M4A**: Better quality than MP3 at same bitrate

## WhatsApp Voice Notes

WhatsApp voice notes are saved as AMR files. To convert them:

   - Copy to computer and convert using online tools

2. **iPhone**:

## Troubleshooting

**"File won't convert"**:

- Try a different converter
- Ensure file is actually AMR format

**"Poor audio quality"**:
- Increase bitrate settings
- Use lossless conversion if available
- Check original file quality

**"File too large after conversion"**:
- Reduce bitrate (64kbps for voice is usually sufficient)
- Use mono instead of stereo for voice recordings
- Consider splitting long recordings
